# Computer Organization & Architecture - Logisim Final Project

## Overview
This project is a **digital circuit design** implemented using **Logisim**, aimed at demonstrating fundamental **Computer Organization and Architecture (COA) concepts**. The design includes various logic circuits that simulate **processor components, memory systems, and computational operations**.

## Impact
- **Enhances Understanding of Digital Systems** â€“ Provides a hands-on approach to learning CPU architecture.
- **Simulates Real-World Processor Operations** â€“ Demonstrates how logic gates, registers, and memory interact.
- **Useful for COA Courses & Research** â€“ Can be used as a reference for students and educators.
- **Encourages Experimentation** â€“ Allows modifications to test different architectures.

## Features
- **Processor Simulation** â€“ Implements essential components of a CPU.
- **ALU Operations** â€“ Simulates basic arithmetic and logic operations.
- **Memory System** â€“ RAM and register file simulations.
- **Control Unit** â€“ Manages data flow between processor components.
- **Logisim Compatibility** â€“ Designed to be opened and simulated within Logisim.
